# fleet-telemetrics-analysis
Project Overview
This project provides an end-to-end analytics solution for a fleet of over 50 vehicles, combining trip data, cost modeling, and interactive dashboards. It simulates real-world fleet operations using synthetic data for vehicles, drivers, financials, and trip logs, enriched with real-world reference data such as fuel prices, road coordinates, and market-based operational costs.

The goal is to analyze fleet performance, maintenance, operating costs, and driver impact to support data-driven decision-making in fleet management.


##  Data Disclaimer

This project uses a mix of **synthetic** and **real-world-sourced** data:

- **Synthetic data:**  
  Vehicle records, driver information, trip logs, and financial figures have been fully generated for simulation purposes. No real personal or company data is used.

- **Real-world references:**  
  - Fuel prices are based on publicly available UK rates  
  - Road coordinates come from London open map data  
  - Material and operation costs are based on market prices in London  
  - Insurance estimates are taken from online quotes

All external data sources used are public and non-sensitive. This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.
